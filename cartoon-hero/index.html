			<h2>The TV show, character and whatever else.</h2>
			<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px;font-size: 20px;" id="description">A cartoon character voiced fantastically by Will Arnett, who is a hollywood actor that had his '15 minutes of fame' in a 90's TV show called "Horsin' around". His peers constantly remind him that he is a has-been, but he begs to differ.</p>
			<h2>Bojack's characteristics</h2>
			<ol style="border-bottom-width: 10px;padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px">
				<ul>-He is depressed as fuck.</ul>
				<ul>-He's considered immature by his peers, and can't hold a relationship.</ul>
				<ul>-He is remarkably prone to drug addiction.</ul>
				<ul>-He tries to fill the gaping hole in his life with meaningless sex, drugs and alcohol.</ul>
				<ul>-Despite his issues, he's a kind person and he cares deeply for those near him.</ul>
